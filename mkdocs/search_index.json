Depending on the application, a system of sensor, wireless and motor control elements can be built in a modular way and programmed with a few lines of code. No soldering iron is needed. Both the hardware and the software are open source. After a brief overview of the available sensors and actuators, we will quickly start with the actual programming. Together, we will explore different applications, architectures, and the combination of TinkerForge with Java. Using sensors, actuators and some other elements, we will take the first steps and delve into the practical world of IoT with Java 8 and TinkerForge. \n\n\nWhat do I need to bring?\n\n\n\n\nA laptop on which you can install software\n\n\nJava 8 (JDK) installed and running\n\n\nA JDK 8 capable IDE\n\n\n\n\nOptionally, you can of course also bring your own Raspberry Pi or the like.\n\n\nGoals:\n\n\n\n\naddressing sensors, storing data and display them using JavaFX.\n\n\n(opt) parallel processing of sensor data streams using Java 8 Streams\n\n\nusing touch elements\n\n\n\n\n\n@Test\n  public void test004() throws Exception {\n    final ServiceHandle\nBusinessService\n serviceHandle = locator.getServiceHandle(BusinessService.class);\n    final BusinessService myService = serviceHandle.getService();\n    Assert.assertNotNull(myService);\n\n    Assert.assertEquals(myService.getClass(), BusinessServiceImplA.class);\n    System.out.println(\nmyService.doWork(\\\nh\\\n) = \n + myService.doWork(\nh\n));\n\n    final Object serviceData = serviceHandle.getServiceData();\n    System.out.println(\nserviceData = \n + serviceData);\n\n\n  }\n\n\n\n\nTalks\n\n\nProxy Deep Dive\n\n\nAt this talk we will start from the basics and come shortly to Dynamic-/Static-Proxies, generated typesave DynamicObjectAdapter, ProxyBuilder and more.

The goal is to get the CodeCoverage as high as possible on the row level, but not higher than necessary.\nWhat exactly does it mean? A CodeCoverage of appr. 75% on the row level is very good and can already provide a basis.

How can the coverage be defined and what can be achieved?\nHow can it be integrated into an existing project and what should be considered while running a test?\n\n\nDI and CDI frameworks internals\n\n\nDependency Injection is now part of nearly every Java project. But what is the difference between DI and CDI. How to decide what I could use better, what  frameworks are available and what are the differences for me as a programmer? What could be an option for the IoT-, Desktop- or Webproject?\n\n\nIn this talk we will get an overview over different frameworks and how they are working. We are not checking the well known big one only, but we are looking at some small sometimes specialized implementations.",
